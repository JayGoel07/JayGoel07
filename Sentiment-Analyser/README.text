# VADER SENTIMENT 
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It performs well on texts from various domains.

# Sentiment Analysis Overview
Sentiment analysis, a crucial area in Natural Language Processing, involves the automatic detection of affective states in text. It is widely applied to materials such as product reviews on online shopping websites like Amazon, movie reviews, or social media posts. Sentiment analysis can be as basic as classifying text polarity (positive/negative) or delve deeper into various sentiment states.

This technique helps companies make informed decisions. For instance, if public sentiment toward a product is negative, a company might consider modifying the product or halting production to avoid losses.

Public sentiment can be sourced from interviews, opinion polls, and surveys. However, with the rise of social media, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become rich sources for public sentiment analysis.

# Output
The app provides sentiment analysis output, classifying the text's sentiment polarity and offering insights into public opinion.
